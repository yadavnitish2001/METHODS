## 1. Introduction to Methods

In programming, a method is a named block of code that performs a specific task or set of tasks. Methods allow for code reuse, abstraction, and organization, contributing to maintainable and scalable software.

## 2. Function Declaration and Definition

A method is declared and defined using a specific syntax in each programming language. This section provides examples in common languages like Python, Java, and JavaScript.
